        Imagine you are in a movie critiquing class. One of your assignments is
        to reflect on your movie preferences and write an essay about your movie
        preferences and what you learned through reflecting on your movie
        preferences. The task of this study is to write personal reflection
        notes to help you write the essay. You will use a
        <span className="ms-1 me-1 font-bold">
          “preference visualization system”
        </span>
        to help you reflect on your movie preferences; the tool visualizes your
        movie preferences and juxtaposes them against people who are similar to
        you.

        Why should I care about understanding and developing my preferences?

        We usually have a baseline understanding of movies that we like and
        dislike. Our movie-watching behavior tends to be motivated by our movie
        likes and dislikes. However, it is likely that we are yet to realize the
        nuances and the range of our movie preferences.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3">
        Understanding your preferences can help you learn about the nuances of
        your movie preferences. It can also help you learn about the range of
        your movie preferences. Furthermore, understanding your preferences
        opens avenues for you to explore new movies that you have not considered
        before. This could help extend your preferences. Alternatively,
        exploring new movies can help you realize that you are not interested
        and help you refine your likes and dislikes.
